    <center><h1>HTML Interview Questions</h1></center><hr>
    <h3>Q1). What is the difference between div and span ?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, <i>div</i> stands for division element. It is a block-level element, i.e, it takes the entire width of the page or the parent container. It begins with a new line.The div tag is often used to classify paragraphs, headings, images, and links. It is applicable for creating CSS based HTML layouts. It supports attributes and is used to wrap a section that requires highlighting</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <i>span</i>is an inline element., i.e, it takes the width of the content only.It is used to stylise the text.
        It does not begin with a new line and also,it does not support attributes. It wraps any particular word and is used to highlight it.
    </p>
    <h3>Q2). What is the difference between class and Ids ?</h3>
    <p>The class attribute is used to specify the class name for an HTML element. Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value. Also, it is mainly used to associate the styles written in the stylesheet with the HTML elements,whereas a value of id attribute of one element cannot be associated with another HTML elements.A class is represented by (".") and an id is represented by ("#")
    </p>
    <h3>Q3). What are self-closing tags ?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, there are certain tags that need not be closed. There are elements in HTML called void elements, such as images and links, that do not strictly require closing tags because of their inherent structure.Elements that dont have any content in it are 
    called empty tags.
        Examples are: br tag, input tag, hr tag, link tag, image tag etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Q4). How many types of headings are there? How to know which one is to be used and where?</h3>
    <p>There are 6 types of headin tags, i.e, from h1 to h6 where the priority order is: h1>h2>h3>h4>h5>h6 The size and font-weight of h1 is the highest and that of h6 is the lowest. Every html page must have atleast one heading tag.</p>
    <h3>Q5). What is the difference between bloack and inline ?</h3>
    <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available. It always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. Examples- p, div, input, form, table, section etc.
    An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. Examples- b, br, span, img, label, button etc.</p>
    <h3>Q6). What is the difference between em and strong ?</h3>
    <p>In HTML, we use symantic tags to make the page visually pleasing. They put a better impact on the user and helps in increasing the ratings of the website. The emphasis tag (em) is a better alternative of the italic tag (i) whereas the strong tag (s) is a better alternative of the bold tag (b).</p>
    <h3>Q7). What are attributes?</h3>
    <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and should be written in lowercase format only. Examples- type, class, id, name, action, for, href, src etc.</p>
    <h3>Q8). Explain br tags.</h3>
    <p>The br HTML element gives a line break in the text. It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is important.The usage of br tags should be avoided. Instead CSS properties must be used to incorporate the br use.</p>
    <h3>Q9). What are semantic tags?</h3>
    <p>In HTML,the semantic tags are used to specify the purpose of the content. It adds meaning to the matter.
        Examples- header tag, form tag, table tag, nav tag etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Q10). What is the difference between HTML tags and elements ?</h3>
    <p>HTML tag is just opening or closing entity. 
        HTML tag is just opening or closing entity represeted within ( < > ) ,whereas HTML element encompasses opening tag, closing tag, and the content.</p>
